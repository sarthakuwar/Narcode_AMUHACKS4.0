# ⚡ UniPay – Unified UPI Payment Gateway

## 📌 Overview

**UniPay** is a modern, developer-centric UPI payment gateway that eliminates the need for traditional user authentication or complex onboarding. Unlike other gateways (e.g., Razorpay, Stripe), UniPay enables users to accept payments from any UPI-enabled app—**without requiring the payer to install any additional software or the receiver to track payments manually.**

Users simply register their **UPI ID** to generate a **unique payment key**, which is then used to create a **QR code**. This code can be shared anywhere to receive payments. When someone pays using any UPI app (like Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, etc.), the UniPay **mobile app** instantly notifies the user of the transaction—providing a unified, real-time tracking system.
